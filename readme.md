* Was the task clear? Did you feel like anything was missing or difficult to understand?

   Nope, task was very clear, did not have any issues understanding what to do.

* How much time did you spend on understanding vs designing vs coding vs testing?

  I spent most of the time coding the API and designing the schema. Understanding took no time at all. I would have love to write some unit tests but did not get a chance to
* Why did you choose the technologies you used? (Please touch on programming language,
datastore, and any major libraries or frameworks.)

  I used PHP with Laravel 5.2 as that's what I have the most experience building a REST API on.
* Are there any bottlenecks with your solution? if so, what are they and what can you do to fix
them/minimize their impact?

  There are some endpoints that could be optimize more.
  For example, if I had more time I would like to optimize the User Show endpoint. Loading the relationships just get to the count could be done differently. Also the upload script could be written more efficently.
* Would your system work for a dump with a billion rows?

  It should, it would just take way to long. I would need to optimize the script better.
* What would you have done differently if you had more time?

  Optimized some of the queries and data dump script. Added Unit Tests. Created a Repository file for each Service that needed a database call. Redone the validation as it has a lot of reused code. Added some authentication. There is a lot to be done before this would be production ready.
* How confident are you in your solution and why?

  Very confident. I'm using a language and framework I am comfortable in. This is some of the work I do at my current job.
* Anything else you want to share about your solution or the problem :)

    Thank you for taking the time to look at my project. I look forward to discussing it with you!
